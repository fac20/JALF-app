Student project completed over three weeks for the Founders and Coders bootcamp. 

App to help diabetics calculate the insulin doses they need to take according to the amount of carbohydrates they will eat, the exercise they will do ...

### The problem we'd like to solve
Many diabetics, both type 1 and 2) struggle with calculating how much medication to take with meals. The ratio of carbohydrate portion (CP) to insulin units varies from person to person and we have to do many calculations throughout the day to workout how much medication to take. Some people really struggle with the maths of this and get the dosage wrong.

'As a diabetic who struggles with their medication, I would like an app to help me easily calculate how much insulin I need for specific meals (basal bolus regime), so that I can safely administer the correct dosage and reduce the number of dangerous hypoglycaemic episodes and improve my HbA1c'

### Who are the stakeholders?
People with type 1 (and type 2 diabetes)

### What is currently being done to solve this problem?
There are online insulin calculators available and also online databases for food, but nothing combined. A lot of people don't want to use multiple apps for this and so most end up doing guess work.

## How to get this up and running 
Unforunately, we ran into a couple of issues with deploying on Heroku, so this needs to be run locally.

First, set up the backend: Clone [this](https://github.com/fac20/JALF-backend) repo, run `npm i` and then `npx nodemon start`.

For the front end: clone this repo, run `npm i` and the `npm start` to start up the front end.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
